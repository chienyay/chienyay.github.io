		<dfn>"A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.

		Rainbows can be full circles. However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground,[1] and centered on a line from the Sun to the observer's eye.

		In a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side. This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it.

		In a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed, with red on the inner side of the arc. This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it."</dfn> --from wikipedia

		<dfn>"Monsta X (Korean: <a lang="ko">몬스타엑스</a>; stylized as MONSTA X) is a South Korean boy group formed through the reality survival program No.Mercy by Starship Entertainment. The group is currently composed of six members: Shownu, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, Joohoney and I.M, with former member Wonho leaving the group in October 2019.

		The group debuted on May 14, 2015 with their first EP Trespass.[3] In March 2017, Monsta X released their first studio album and final part of The Clan series The Clan Pt. 2.5: The Final Chapter.[4] Since 2018, Monsta X had four Japanese singles certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Since 2019, five of their Korean albums had been certified platinum by the Korea Music Content Association. In February 2020, Monsta X's first English album All About Luv ranked number five on the US Billboard 200 and number seven on the US Rolling Stone Top 200.[5][6]

		Since debut, Monsta X has been known for their aggressive style, combining elements of hip hop, EDM and pop.[1][7] This aggressive style with "tracks centred around loud, clattering, electronic instrumentals, vicious rap verses and striking vocals" has been influential across the fourth generation of K-pop."</dfn> --from wikipedia
